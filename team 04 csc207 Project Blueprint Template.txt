[PLEASE REMEMBER TO REMOVE ALL COMMENTS THAT APPEAR IN THE SQUARE BRACKETS [] BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR TEAM’S BLUEPRINT]Project Specification for Group TUT0101-BA3195-04Team Name: TUT0101-BA3195-04Domain: Personal finance management — track transactions, budgets, recurring payments, and generate weekly/monthly insights.User Stories: User story 1: Import & view transactions.As a user, I want to import my bank CSV so I can see my recent transactions in one place.User story 2: Add & edit transactions. As a user, I want to add or edit transactions manually so errors can be fixed.User story 3: Categorize spending.As a user, I want to assign categories to transactions so I can see where my money goes.User story 4: Auto-categorization.As a user, I want the app to suggest categories based on merchant/name so I save time.User Story 5: Budgets.As a user, I want to set monthly budgets per category and get notified when I approach/ exceed them.User Story 6: Weekly reports.As a user, I want weekly email or in-app reports summarizing my spending and trends.Use Cases:Use Case 1 — Import Transactions (CSV)Main Flow:1. User uploads CSV.2. System parses CSV, normalizes date/amount fields, and creates Transaction records.3. System attempts auto-categorization and shows preview for user confirmation.Alternative Flows:* CSV format mismatch ? display parsing hints and sample template.* Duplicate transactions detected ? show option to skip or merge.Use Case 2 — Add & Edit TransactionsMain Flow:1. User selects “Add Transaction” or clicks an existing record to edit.2. System displays input fields (date, amount, category, description, merchant).3. User enters or modifies details and saves.4. System validates entries and updates the transaction list.Alternative Flows:* Invalid input (e.g., missing date or negative amount) ? prompt user to correct.* Duplicate entry detected ? ask user to confirm save or merge.Use Case 3 — Categorize SpendingMain Flow:1. User opens transaction list.2. User selects a transaction and chooses a category from predefined options (e.g., Food, Rent, Transport).3. System saves category and updates spending summary by category.Alternative Flows:* User wants to create a new category ? prompt to add and save it to the category list.Use Case 4 — Auto-CategorizationMain Flow:1. System analyzes transaction merchant names and patterns.2. System suggests a category automatically during import or entry.3. User reviews and can accept or change the suggested category.Use Case 5 — BudgetsMain Flow:1. User sets monthly budget limits for each spending category.2. System tracks actual spending against each budget.3. When spending nears or exceeds the limit, system shows visual warning or sends a notification.Alternative Flows:* No budget set ? system prompts user to create one when tracking is attempted.* User changes budget mid-month ? system recalculates progress proportionally.Use Case 6 — Weekly ReportsMain Flow:1. System compiles weekly summary of transactions and category spending.2. Generates visual insights (charts, top categories, changes from last week).MVP:LeadUse Case [title of use case from previous section]User Story [optionally, include this column to indicate which user story this use case is associated with]DianaUse Case #1User Story #1CynthiaUse Case #2RyanUse Case #5EricUse Case #4Ben Use Case #6User Story #mProposed Entities for the Domain:1.
